## Goal 

The Office of Acquisition (OA) is seeking nontraditional and extraordinary vendors capable of providing virtual training on Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) topics.

## About Us

The Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Office of Acquisition (OA) is a small, creative and collaborative contracting shop that focuses on applying modern and agile acquisition methodologies to our procurements. 

We are a 13 member team of virtual employees, consisting of contracting officers, contract specialists, along with procurement and program analysts. At TTS, we are passionate about our mission to improve the public’s experience with the government by helping agencies build, buy and share technology that allows them to better service the public. OA is enthusiastic about creating a socially progressive atmosphere and promoting a safe and open space within the virtual office environment. We embody and embrace the values of TTS, which are Inclusion, Integrity and Impact.  

## What We’re Seeking

### Objectives

OA seeks commercially modern, human-centered training on diversity, equity & inclusion matters for its team members. We are interested in both short and/or longer duration training that may span one session or over multiple days. 

Relevant topics may include but _(are not limited to)_ the following:
* Workplace harassment 
* Workplace collaboration 
* Sexual harassment
* Online harassment
* Conflict de-escalation 
* Bystander intervention
* Anti-racism
* Implicit bias and microaggressions
* Understanding cultural competencies
* Embracing cultural difference in the workplace
* Effective time management and understanding cultural differences
* Mental health awareness
* Disability awareness

### Budget

The training budget is a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) amount of $10,000.00 per training.

### Timeline
OA is seeking to conduct training(s) between June and August 2021. 

## Criteria
The training should have the following qualities at a minimum, in order to be considered:  
* Hosted on a virtual platform 
* Hosted in real-time
* Facilitated by a human being
* Interactive with audience
* Commercially available

## How We'll Decide

OA is eager to find vendors just as excited about DE&I as the team is! The ideal training stands out in its abilities to engage the team and present unique information. 

Additionally, the best fit training aligns with TTS values and OA culture but is also willing to take it a step further, encouraging the OA team to push what is comfortable in order to create conversation around relevant topics in today’s environment. Just the same, it possesses sensitivity and acknowledges different perspectives. 

As long as the training meets the minimum criteria, it will be evaluated holistically, using the broad framework above. 

## Why This is a Great Opportunity

If you are a new vendor to Government contracts, this is the chance to enter into the federal contracting arena. OA is looking forward to discovering vendors that might not otherwise compete for Government contracts. 

The relative small-dollar amount of the potential contract allows quick payment via credit card. And if your business offers various types of training, repeat purchases are possible.
