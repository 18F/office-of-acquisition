## 1.0 General

GSA TTS intends to establish multiple single-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) in accordance with FAR 8.405-3 for Cloud Service Provider (CSP) resellers of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud services as a result of this solicitation. One BPA will be awarded to a CSP reseller of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Additional single-award BPAs may be awarded to resellers of any additional FedRAMP Authorized CSP. TTS will not make awards to multiple quoters for the same CSP. The RFQ is set aside for Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) and Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) only to further our small business goals. SDVOSB and WOSB quoters that resell an IaaS cloud service that is currently FedRamp Authorized at the time of the RFQ closing are invited to submit a quote. 

GSA TTS requires an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution to provide the government with on-demand Cloud IaaS access through available FedRAMP Authorized cloud service providers. TTS desires the ability for the reseller to provide a CSP(s) to not only be immediately and fully compatible with the applications that are currently operational for TTS (currently through Amazon Web Services), but TTS desires to experiment and sandbox with various FedRAMP Authorized CSPs in hopes of developing confidence in utilizing multiple CSPs. 

TTS will not accept a Contractor Teaming Agreement (CTA) as TTS values the efficiency, continuity, and similar experience of working through one quoter for each provided CSP for this specific requirement.

Time and Material (T&M) (with a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) limit) Task Orders will be issued under the respective BPA(s) for specific IaaS cloud services.

Order Level Materials (OLM) under Special Item Number (SIN) 70 500 are included as part of the BPA(s) and may be applicable at the call order level for cloud services acquired in direct support of call order(s) placed against the BPA when the services are not known at the time of award of the BPA. Quoters shall ensure that their Schedule Contract includes the OLM SIN prior to submission. TTS will also ensure prior to award, as applicable, that the quoter’s Schedule Contract includes the following clauses:

  * GSAR 552.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (JAN 2017) (Deviation - FEB 2018) (Alternate I - JAN 2017) (Deviation - FEB 2007) 

  * GSAR 552.238-82 - Special Ordering Procedures for the Acquisition of Order-Level Materials (JAN-2018)

  * SCP-FSS-007 - Special Proposal Instructions for Order-Level Materials Special Item Number (JUN 2018) 

The establishment of the BPA(s) does not use any aspects of FAR 15.3. Utilizing the procedures identified does not obligate the Government to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions with any contractors, solicit proposals/quotes or revisions thereto, or use any other source selection techniques associated with FAR 15.3.

The BPA(s) does not obligate funds. The government is obligated only to the extent of authorized orders actually issued against the BPA. The BPA established for AWS will have a Good Faith Estimate Total BPA amount of $10,000,000. However, for each other BPA that may be awarded for other non-AWS FedRAMP Authorized CSPs, each BPA will have a Good Faith Estimate of $500,000 per single-award.

## 3.0 Technical Submission

### 3.1. Factor 1 - Reseller Abilities Through Oral Presentations 

NOTE: As noted elsewhere, quoters may resell multiple FedRAMP Authorized CSPs and therefore may submit pricing sheets for multiple CSPs. However, the time allowed for Oral Presentations is inclusive of all CSPs being offered by each quoter respectively. Quoters shall consider this when deciding if they will have enough time to reflect their abilities adequately for each CSP being quoted.

**Date and Time:** TTS will schedule the date and time of the presentations with each quoter after the RFQ closing date. TTS reserves the right to reschedule any quoter’s interview date at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

**Format:**

45 minutes - Reseller’s Abilities 
15 minutes - TTS questions related to the Reseller’s Abilities 

#### 3.1.1. Reseller’s Abilities - Factor 1 - Oral Presentation 

The quoter will have 45 minutes to present an overview of their abilities as a reseller for the CSP(s) quoted in the following minimum areas:
* Reseller’s ability to provide a dedicated master payer account for each CSP
* Ability to allow TTS to self-service all capacity activities for each CSP (for example AWS Reserved Instances purchasing, and similar functions for other CSPs)
* Provide ability to use all the CSP Marketplaces (as applicable) directly
* Reseller's ability to allow for TTS to submit support requests directly to all the CSP(s)
* Reseller’s ability to allow for TTS to select the type of support (as applicable) level with no change in reseller discounting for each CSP
* Reseller’s ability to provide TTS with direct access to unaltered CSP billing and usage data for each CSP (not through third party tools such as CloudCheckr)
* Reseller’s ability to provide TTS access to native CSP dashboards, cost tools, and systems (for example, AWS Management Console, AWS Cost Explorer, and AWS Organizations, and similar tools for other CSPs), as well as provide visibility into spending rates using these components 
* Reseller's ability to provide a CSP offering a managed Kubernetes service certified by FedRAMP

After these minimum areas, the quoter may address any other service related differentiator they may have that would separate them from another quoter or address how the reseller may successfully perform any other areas outlined in the PWS for the CSP(s) they are quoting.

 * It is the quoter’s responsibility to provide enough detail for each area presented in order for the Government to gain a full understanding of the quoter’s abilities.

TTS’ questions related to the reseller’s abilities - TTS intends to have a dialogue based on the information presented during the first 45 minutes. This dialogue may be related, but not limited to, to the quoter expanding on the information presented within this section, or the Government sharing a real life scenario and asking the quoter to highlight how they would respond to such a scenario, or how the IaaS cloud service(s) quoted will be used in such a scenario, based on their abilities as a reseller of the IaaS cloud service(s) quoted. 

#### 3.1.2. Oral Presentation Rules and Procedures
* TTS will utilize a screen sharing and screen-recording tool (to document the presentation) during oral presentation. TTS will not share or send out the recording once the presentation is completed.
* It is the quoter’s responsibility to use the available time wisely. Once TTS confirms the presentation has started, the available times outlined above will be closely followed and the presentation will end whether or not the quoter has presented everything they desired to.
* The quoter may not generally ask questions during the oral presentation. Any questions asked must be directed to the Contracting Officer, and should only deal with logistics and conduct of the oral presentation.
* Oral presentations do not constitute discussions. Oral presentations are distinct from the Government's reserved right to conduct exchanges.
* Oral presentations provide an opportunity for dialogue among the parties. Therefore, questions asked by TTS may not be the same for all quoters. The questions to be asked will be reasonable to the information presented and the natural dialogue to that information.
* The quoter shall not have reach-back capabilities during the oral presentation. This means the quoter shall not stop the presentation to make a phone call, or any other type of communication effort, to an associate not currently in the presentation for assistance.

#### 3.1.3. Recommendations and Tips 

For the oral presentation, TTS will utilize a screenshare function to allow the quoter to showcase items that may differentiate the quoter from another quoter. This could include, but not be limited to, showing what an actual invoice looks like that the quoter utilizes for other customers, their ability to provide master payer accounts, their ability to allow access to 1st-party dashboards, etc or otherwise show off the abilities highlighted in Factor 1 or within the BPA.

Note - TTS does not want Powerpoint slides used during the presentation. Powerpoint slides will NOT be evaluated.

### 3.2. Reseller Expertise and Certifications - Factor 2

Quoters currently on Schedule 70 have already been determined to be Authorized Resellers. Therefore, for a FedRamp Authorized IaaS cloud service quoted, the quoter shall submit a list of the IaaS cloud service provider(s) quoted (for example, and illustrative only,  AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc (other FedRAMP Authorized CSP)) and clearly link to or upload any additional certifications that reflect the quoters status and expertise reselling the cloud service. For example, AWS utilizes an AWS Authorized Public Sector Reseller status certification and AWS Advanced Consulting Partner status, and Microsoft Azure utilizes a Gold Partner status. Quoters may submit similar status certifications for any FedRamp Authorized IaaS cloud service quoted that may differentiate them from other quoters or otherwise reflect their CSP status or expertise in reselling the CSP.

## 4.0 Price Submission

Two pricing attachments are available for completion depending on the CSPs being quoted. Quoters shall utilize Attachment 3A when quoting AWS, and Attachment 3B when quoting any other FedRAMP Authorized CSP. Quoters may submit both Attachment 3A and 3B if the quoter can provide AWS and another FedRAMP Authorized CSP.

Using Attachment 3A and/or 3B, the quoter will submit their percentage discount and calculate their pricing. Instructions and an example are included in both attachments.
  
IaaS services quoted shall already be priced on the quoter’s Schedule Contract utilizing Schedule 70 SIN SIN 132-40.

In accordance with FAR 8.405-4, GSA requests and seeks further discounts, price reductions, and volume-pricing savings from the Schedule price rate for the IaaS services quoted.

### 4.1. Price Quote

Quoters shall submit a percentage discount for the CSP quoted for each period of performance. The percentage discount is the percentage billing discount off of the commercial price across the entire AWS IaaS suite (cloud services catalog, marketplace, or otherwise available cloud services) or other FedRAMP Authorized CSP IaaS suite (as applicable), negotiated for the Schedule 70 contract. Pricing will be evaluated by reviewing the sum total of the proposed percentage billing discount across all periods of performance against the estimated funding levels. 

The “Estimated Funding Levels” stated within Attachment 3A/3B are for evaluation purposes only. Actual funding levels after award may fluctuate higher or lower per CSP (as applicable) depending on funding and needs.

Within Attachment 3A/3B, TTS has completed an “Example” to assist quoters complete the attachment.

Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices quoted for the last option year to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).

#### 4.1.1. Price Submittal - Percentage Discount

Each quoter shall apply a minimum discount percentage for each of the CSP(s) for the base year and each option year. Quoters shall only provide a minimum percent discount for the IaaS CSP you are authorized to resell under your FSS Contract. 

The percent discount shall be fixed as a minimum discount percentage at the time of award for each period of performance, but TTS encourages the reseller to offer subsequently increasing discounts that apply to the IaaS CSP throughout the life of the order as the reseller market for IaaS cloud services becomes more competitive, TTS resource consumption increases under this requirement, and/or the reseller’s processes for meeting the requirements of the delivery become more refined and efficient.


Since TTS users of information technology are both extremely aware of published pricing and very sensitive about ensuring TTS receives the best possible pricing, in addition to meeting all other PWS requirements, the reseller’s minimum discount percentage and subsequent additional discounts throughout the life of the order (as applicable) presents a prime opportunity for the reseller to be viewed as responsive to the Agency requirement on an on-going basis. Furthermore, TTS will constantly be assessing the dynamic cloud services marketplace on behalf of the TTS user base to ensure this requirement remains the best possible vehicle for, cost-wise and other, acquiring IaaS cloud services to meet the Agency’s very diverse needs.

TTS requires a minimum discount percentage across all CSPs that would be credited by the reseller on each monthly invoice based on the total amount of resources consumed and invoiced to TTS for the month per CSP. This will enable any discount to be immediately realized by individual TTS customers instead of waiting for particular cost thresholds to be met in future months, since it is possible the customer may have completed their use of any of the CSPs by the time the credits are applied by the reseller. 

#### 4.1.2. Price Submittal - Rate

The quoter shall certify that any commercial price drop of commercial pricing during any period of performance becomes effective at the same time the drop becomes effective with the CSP. During any period of performance, the quoter shall supply their FSS Contract prices for each CSP upon request within three business days.

By submission of the quote, quoters understand that rates may not exceed commercial public cloud rates for IaaS CSP(s) available at any time in the period of performance, or the rates stated within their FSS Contract approved pricing sheets, whichever is lower. 

Quoters should assume the monthly invoice costs are all encompassing.

Cloud services consumed by TTS may be significantly less than the BPA ceiling estimate and/or the amount actually funded. TTS does not guarantee all IaaS cloud services will be utilized. As such, any percentage discount should address the strong possibility that in any single month the actual invoice to TTS may fluctuate from month to month based on actual consumption and usage.  TTS will not accept discounts tied to minimum monthly invoiced amounts.

#### 4.2. Potential Organizational Conflict of Interest Statement

Quoters, including subcontractors as applicable, shall provide a signed Organizational Conflict of Interest Statement (see Attachment 4). The statement shall concisely describe all relevant facts concerning any actual or potential organizational conflict of interest.

No award shall be made until any potential conflict of interest has been neutralized or mitigated to the satisfaction of the CO in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest. If the CO determines that a potential conflict can be avoided, effectively mitigated, or otherwise resolved through the inclusion of a special task order clause, the terms of the clause will be subject to negotiation.

## 5.0 Evaluation

### 5.1 Evaluation Criteria and Basis of Award

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4. FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procurement procedures are not being utilized, except procedures within FAR Part 15.4, which states Contract Pricing may be utilized, as allowed, for price analysis. All submissions in response to this solicitation are considered quotations and not proposals or offers, even if labeled as such. The quoters agree to and are bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this solicitation. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, solicit final revised quotations, or use other techniques associated with FAR Part 15. All quotes from Schedule quoters shall be fairly considered.

There is no requirement to capture relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks as outlined in FAR 15.305. There is no scoring system, such as colors, adjectives, or points. The evaluation will be streamlined by using pluses/minuses and narrative statements to justify the Confidence Ratings assigned and the ultimate award decision. 


Award(s) will be based on a determination of best value, utilizing trade-offs (as applicable), to the Government, price and other factors considered. “Best value” means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the RFQ. Best value evaluation is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the quoted solution that provides the optimal results to the Government. 

In addition to price, the following non-price factors shall be used to evaluate quotations. The non-price factors are in descending order of importance:

1. Reseller Abilities 
2. Reseller’s Expertise and Certifications

As submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the total evaluated price will become more important. Therefore, quoters are encouraged to provide their best price up front.

The Government is more concerned with obtaining a technically superior solution than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the government. However, the government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical value. **Quoters are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.**

**At least one award will be made for AWS cloud services as a result of this RFQ.  TTS may not make an award for every CSP quoted however if the CSP is not determined to be in the best interest of the Government. As this RFQ is set aside for SDVOSB and WOSB vendors, an award may be made to one SDVOSB vendor only, one WOSB vendor only, or both types depending on what is in the best interest of the Government.**

Note - Quoters submitting a quote shall have a Federal Supply Schedule contract that includes a sufficient period of performance to cover the potential duration of the anticipated BPA.

#### 5.1.1. Technical Evaluation

**Factor 1: Reseller Abilities**
The Government will evaluate the minimum areas outlined in Section 3.1. After these minimum areas, the quoter may address any other service related differentiator they may have that would separate them from another quoter or address how the reseller may successfully perform any other areas outlined in the PWS.

**Factor 2: Reseller’s Expertise and Certifications**
The Government will evaluate any CSP certification or status (“Gold Partner”, AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, etc, for illustration) related differentiator they may have that would separate them from another quoter and give the Government greater confidence in their expertise as a reseller for the CSP(s) quoted. The certification or status level shall reflect the certification or status of the quoter, not an individual employee of the quoter.

NOTE - TTS will rely on the information submitted by the quoter and/or by reviewing CSP Authorized Lists (via the commercial website) as applicable or available.

**Evaluation of Price**
Pricing will be evaluated in accordance with the information found in Section 4 & 5 above and in accordance with 8.4 and FSS procedures.

### 5.2 Evaluation Process
Technical and pricing may be reviewed concurrently.

## 6.0 TTS Transparency Policy

Quoters are advised that TTS reserves the right to publish documents associated with this acquisition on a publicly-available website, including any Requests for Quotation or their amendments, as well as question and answer exchanges with quoters with source-identifying information removed. TTS reserves the right to publish any other relevant information that is not confidential or proprietary in nature, but will not publish any source-selection sensitive information that would otherwise implicate procurement integrity concerns.

Upon award of the acquisition, TTS may publish the total price of the selected quote and certain non-source-identifying data (e.g. the number of bids, the mean price, the median, and the standard deviation of price). During the performance of this task order, TTS may similarly publish data related to project management (e.g. user stories, milestones, and performance metrics) and top-line spending data.

## 7.0 External Information Systems - IT Security and Privacy Requirements
 
The Contracting Officer for this solicitation will provide you with the link in your notification of award letter or in a separate email. 
If the reselling quoter provides their own applications, tools, or dashboards other than the native applications, tools, or dashboards by the FedRAMP Authorized CSPs quoted, the quoter shall first notify the TTS Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer’s Representative. If approved by the CO and COR, the applications, tools, or dashboards (system) are subject to the requirements of Section 2 of GSA’s guide Security and Privacy Requirements for IT Acquisition Efforts [CIO-IT Security 09-48, Rev. 4] 01/25/2018 (and any future update of the guide) on a conditional basis.

## 8.0 INFORM Control Pilot

This solicitation is part of a control group study for a GSA pilot initiative designed to enhance the quality and usefulness of postaward communications by providing greater transparency and openness into the procurement process. 
 
The control group will receive the traditional postaward activities (of a FAR Part 8 buy) as requested by the quoters.
 
After the solicitation is awarded and appropriate activities, as allowed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, are completed, quoters will be asked to complete an Industry Satisfaction Survey.  Your feedback will be used to develop a meaningful postaward process that will improve communication between the government and industry.
