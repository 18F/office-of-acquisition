## What we offer

TTS Office of Acquisition (OA) is uniquely focused on helping government buy modern digital technologies for internal and external clients. We specialize in procuring Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and IT professional services. 

## Clients

### TTS internal procurement

We buy IT products/services for TTS offices such as Clients & Markets, Solutions, and Business Operations. If you are within TTS and your procurement need costs less than $10,000, please visit the [Purchase Requests]({{ site.baseurl }}/purchase-requests/) section in the handbook.

If you are within TTS and your procurement need costs more than the micro-purchase threshold ($10,000), please visit the [Procurement over $10k]({{ site.baseurl }}/procurements-over-10000/) section in the handbook.

### TTS assisted acquisition

In partnership with 18F, we procure modern, digital technologies for TTSâ€™ partner agencies.  Procurement of services and/or products over $10k that will partially or fully support your partner(s) outside of TTS (including other GSA offices and partner agencies), paid partially or fully by your partner(s), will be considered an assisted acquisition. 

## How we work

- We strive to procure technology in a transparent and cost-effective way. We collaborate directly with our internal clients to create the acquisition strategy and build the acquisition package together. We focus on procurements under $10 million to prevent vendor lock-in. We use low dollar amounts and option periods so that we can assess the results of our acquisitions, and refine our approaches over time to find the best value solution. 
- In the spirit of innovation, we continue to experiment with new, collaborative ways of doing procurement while adhering to the various regulations and policies governing our work.
